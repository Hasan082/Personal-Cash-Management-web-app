Personal Cash Management Web App
================================

A lightweight Django app to track personal income and expenses with a simple dashboard showing totals, recent activity and charts.

Quick features
- User registration and login
- Add / edit / delete income (AddCash) and expenses
- Dashboard with totals and recent transactions
- Charts (Chart.js) for monthly income vs expenses and top expenses

Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- virtualenv (recommended)

Setup (local)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment

	```bash
	python3 -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate
	```

2. Install dependencies

	```bash
	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

3. Run migrations

	```bash
	python3 manage.py migrate
	```

4. Create a superuser (optional)

	```bash
	python3 manage.py createsuperuser
	```

5. Run the development server

	```bash
	python3 manage.py runserver 9001
	```

6. Open the app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:9001/`

Notes about charts and static assets
- The dashboard uses Chart.js via CDN (configured in `ManageCash/templates/base.html`). If you prefer a local copy, add Chart.js to `static/js/` and update the template.
- Chart data is prepared in `ManageCash/views.py` and passed as JSON to the template. The charts are initialized by `hasan_wadp_19_ManageCash/static/js/dashboard.js`.

Customization
- Dashboard template: `ManageCash/templates/pages/dashboard.html`
- Views: `ManageCash/views.py` (the `dashboard_view` builds monthly totals and recent transactions)
- Models: `ManageCash/models.py` (AddCash, Expense, Profile)

Useful commands
- Run Django system checks: `python3 manage.py check`
- Run tests (if any): `python3 manage.py test`
- Collect static files for production: `python3 manage.py collectstatic`

Troubleshooting
- If charts don't render, open browser DevTools console and check for errors. Ensure Chart.js CDN is reachable or switch to a local JS file.
- If Django is not found, ensure the virtualenv is activated and dependencies are installed.

## Project Details

### Purpose
This project is a compact Django application for tracking personal income and expenses. It focuses on simple CRUD operations, a concise dashboard for quick insights, and lightweight visualizations to help users understand their cash flow.

### Architecture & Data Flow
- Models: `Profile`, `AddCash` (income), and `Expense` — transactions inherit common fields from an abstract `TransactionBase`.
- Views: server-side views handle authentication, CRUD for transactions, and `dashboard_view` aggregates totals and prepares JSON-encoded time series for charts.
- Templates: server-rendered templates in `ManageCash/templates/` display data; the dashboard template receives JSON for charts and a `recent_tx` list for recent activity.
- Client: `hasan_wadp_19_ManageCash/static/js/dashboard.js` reads `window.dashboardData` and initializes Chart.js charts inside `.chart-container` elements.

### Important Files
- `ManageCash/models.py` — data models and fields (amounts use `DecimalField`).
- `ManageCash/views.py` — request handlers and dashboard aggregation logic.
- `ManageCash/forms.py` — form definitions used for create/edit flows.
- `ManageCash/templates/pages/dashboard.html` — dashboard layout and the inline data bridge (sets `window.dashboardData`).
- `hasan_wadp_19_ManageCash/static/js/dashboard.js` — chart initialization logic (separate static file).
- `hasan_wadp_19_ManageCash/static/main.css` — app styles and chart container sizing.

### How Dashboard Data Is Built
- The dashboard computes per-user totals by aggregating `Sum('amount')` on filtered QuerySets.
- A 6-month series is generated by computing month boundaries and querying transactions in each month (`datetime__gte` and `datetime__lt`).
- Recent transactions are created by merging the most recent incomes and expenses, sorting by `datetime`, and slicing to the top N items.
- The view JSON-encodes arrays (labels and values) and the template injects them into `window.dashboardData` for the JS initializer.

### Testing & Quality
- Add unit tests for `dashboard_view` to verify aggregation logic and for CRUD endpoints.
- Use `flake8` for linting and `black` for formatting.

### Extension Ideas
- Expense categories and a category breakdown chart.
- Monthly budgets or savings goal per user with visual progress.
- CSV/Excel export for transactions and reports.
- Quick-add modal using AJAX and `crispy_forms` for a smoother UX.

If you want, I can add one of the extension features above or create a sample unit test for `dashboard_view`.
